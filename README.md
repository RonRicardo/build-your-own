# Build Your Own
### Currently -- you're fully able to build a single page application that gets information and allows a user to interact with it. Let's try that out!

Within this repo we've provided you:
 - Index.html
 - Index.js with an init function
 - A db.json file that can be used with JSON server
 - Pre-installed [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for styling

Use what you've been given to interact with other APIs and render things to the DOM. Feel free to modify _any_ file that you've been given and to add new ones if necessary.

Suggestions on features to add:
 * Likes
 * Rendering a list of information to a page
 * Being able to sort a list of info
 * Different views -- for example: if you added a list of recipes, it'd be nice to click on a recipe name and see more details about it!
